            <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                <li>Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma</li>
                <li>Pityriasis Lichenoides Chronica</li>
                <li>Nummular Eczema</li>
                <li>Discoid Lupus Erythematosus DLE</li>
                <li>Mycosis Fungoides</li>
                <li>Squamous Cell Carcinoma </li>
                
            </ul>

            <h4>CAUSES</h4>
            <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                <li>acquired from an active lesion of an animal, direct human contact, or from soil</li>
                <li>Human to human. Ringworm often spreads by direct, skin-to-skin contact with an infected person</li>
                <li>Animal to human. You can contract ringworm by touching an animal with ringworm. Ringworm can spread while petting or grooming dogs or cats. It's also fairly common in cows</li>
                <li>Object to human. Ringworm can spread by contact with objects or surfaces that an infected person or animal has recently touched or rubbed against, such as clothing, towels, bedding and linens, combs, and brushes</li>
                <li>Soil to human. In rare cases, ringworm can be spread to humans by contact with infected soil. Infection would most likely occur only from prolonged contact with highly infected soil</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>SYMPTOMS</h4>
            <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                <li>lesions of the trunk and limbs</li>
                <li>circular and sharply marginated with a raised edge</li>
                <li>scaling is common but not constant</li>
                <li>may also be eczematous, vesicular and pustular</li>
            </ul>
